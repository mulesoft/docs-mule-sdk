To help troubleshooting some SDK components, verbose logging can be enabled in order to get more information about their status, behaviour, etc.
Because of the impact to the application performance, limit verbose logging to testing and troubleshooting operations.

== SDK Components Logging

Currently, SDK supports logging information for the following components

[%header,cols="2,3"]
|===
| Component Name | Logging Capabilities
| <<sources#, Source>> | Logs information about the source lifecycle, when it starts and stops.
In case of error and reconnection, it provides the full stack trace associated with the raised exception.
For cluster environments, it provides source status info, indicating whether it is the primary one or not.
| <<polling-sources#, Polling Source>> | Logs information about accepted and/or rejected items by the source.
In case of rejection, logs information about its cause.
| <<polling-sources#_watermarking, Polling Source Watermarking>> | Logs detailed information about watermarking handling on Polling Sources.
This is very low level logic and its trace logging should only be enabled when debugging/troubleshooting related to this functionality is needed.

== Enable SDK Verbose Logging

SDK verbose logging can be enabled by manually setting in Anypoint Studio or via Anypoint Runtime Manager if you are using CloudHub APIs.
In both cases, information will be logged to the application's log file

=== Enable logging via Anypoint Studio

To enable verbose logging using Anypoint Studio, the `log4j2.xml` configuration file should be changed as indicated on the steps below

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.

. Add an `<AsyncLogger>` tag inside the `<Loggers>` tag:

----
<Loggers>
    ...
    <AsyncLogger name="<component's fully qualified name>" level="<logging level>"/>
    ...
</Loggers>
----

=== Enable logging via Anypoint Runtime Manager

To enable verbose logging via Anpoint Runtime Manager, follow the steps below:

. Access Anypoint Runtime Manager.
. Select the desired application.
. Go to *Settings* on the left pane
. In the *Logging* tab, add the `component's fully qualified name` and the logging level (DEBUG or TRACE).
. Apply the changes.

=== SDK Components Fully Qualified Name and Logging Level

Independently of the method chosen to enable verbose logging, when configuring it the corresponding component's fully qualified name and logging level must be specified.
Use the table below for reference:

[%header,cols="2,2,1"]
|===
| Name | Fully Qualified Name | Log Level
| Source|`org.mule.runtime.module.extension.internal.runtime.source.ExtensionMessageSource`| `DEBUG`
| Polling Source|`org.mule.runtime.module.extension.internal.runtime.source.poll.PollingSourceWrapper`| `DEBUG`
| Polling Source Watermarking|`org.mule.runtime.module.extension.internal.runtime.source.poll.PollingSourceWrapper`| `TRACE`
|===

    <!-- Mule logger -->
    <AsyncLogger name="org.mule.runtime.core.internal.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor" level="INFO"/>
    <AsyncLogger name="org.mule.runtime.module.extension.internal.runtime.source.ExtensionMessageSource" level="DEBUG"/>
    <AsyncRoot level="INFO">
        <AppenderRef ref="file" />
    </AsyncRoot>
