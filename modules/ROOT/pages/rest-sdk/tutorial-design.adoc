= Step 2: Design the Connector

Start the process by designing the connector you would like to build.

== Step 2.1: Choose an Anypoint Connector

Choose an existing Anypoint Connector to modify, such as
https://github.com/mulesoft/mule4-trello-connector[Trello Connector].

== Step 2.2: Add L3 Capabilities

Add L3 capabilities with customization-layer.yaml, in which you can modify the
original connector by setting names, adding descriptions, filtering operations,
changing operation names, or doing input and output transformations. Refer to
xref:rest-sdk/customize-the-connector.adoc[Customize the Connector] for detailed
information on this process.

This https://github.com/mulesoft/mule4-trello-connector/blob/feature/citizen-connector/definitions/citizen-descriptor.yaml[link]
shows an example of the L3 capabilities added to Trello Connector.

== Step 2.3: Generate Java Code

Use customization-layer.yaml to generate a connector with specific Java code.
The generated code is packaged inside `target/generated-sources`.

Optionally, extend the code using custom Java. It is important to note that
in order to preserve the custom code when regenerating the connector, you must
refactor the code by moving the Java class that needs to be extended into an
overwrite folder.

== Step 2.4: Generate Models

Generate models using auto generation. Note that this generation takes
inputs from customization-layer.yaml, which eliminates the need to manually fill
in the gaps from generated models.

. Get the extension model from Exchange and use it to create the customization
model.
. Use the same extension model with the new customization model to generate
the Composer and transformation models.
.  Store the generated models for later use.

== Step 2.5: Onboard the Connector to Exchange

Onboard the connector to Exchange using the following steps:

. Clone the connector code into your machine.
+
`git clone git@github.com:mulesoft/mule4-trello-connector.git`
. Checkout the feature branch you want to release from.
+
`git checkout feature/release/1.2.0`
. Create a branch based off it for the release following the `citizen/release/$VERSION`
naming convention.
+
`git checkout -b citizen/release/1.2.0-DEV3`
. Go to the project's main pom.xml and change the version to the release version.
+
`<version>1.2.0-DEV3</version>`
. Commit the change in this new branch.
+
`git commit -m "Set version number for deploy"`
. Build this branch.
+
`mvn clean install -Dmule.disableSdkComponentIgnore=true -Duser.timezone=UTC -DskipTests`
. Deploy to devx using the bash script.
+
`./deploy.sh to devx`
. Verify it is in the public org in Anypoint Platform and Exchange in
https://devx.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/.
. Tag the version. Begin by fetching the latest tags.
+
`git fetch --tags`
. Check the latest tags to understand the standard in the previous version,
for example in mule-trello-connector-1.1.0.
+
`git tag -l`
. Create a new tag following the `git tag $CONNECTOR_NAME-$VERSION` naming
convention.
+
`git tag mule-trello-connector-1.2.0-DEV3`
. Push the tag using `git push origin $TAG_NAME`.
+
`git push origin mule-trello-connector-1.2.0-DEV3`
. If you want to deploy to qax, use the `./deploy.sh to qax` bash script. If
you want to deploy to stgx, use the ``./deploy.sh to stgx` bash script.
. Validate in either Exchange QAX or Exchange STGX using any Anypoint Platform
user.

== Step 2.6: Auto Generate Auth Schemas and Onboard to CFM

Use Connection Schema and Connection Schema Metadata to generate a
connection creation UI.

The CFM Connectivity Service generates a Connection Schema Model
based on an existing Connection Schema and an optional Connection Schema Metadata.

To create a connection for a connector, the UI requests the Connection Schema
Model for that connector. The UI reads that model and generates a form
in the frontend for creating the connection.

Ensure the Connection Schema is already onboarded before proceeding with the
following steps:

. Part 1: Standard Connection UI (no manual work needed)
+
.. Once the Connection Schema is onboarded, the Connectivity Service generates
a standard Connection Schema Model, inferring as much information as possible
from the schema.
.. The UI retrieves that Connection Schema Model when the user wants to create
a connection for the schema's connector.
.. The UI reads the retrieved Connection Schema Model from the API's response
and generates a form with the fields needed for creating a connection for that
connector.
+

. Part 2: Customize the Connection UI.

+
Customize the standard UI by providing
a Connection Schema Metadata file through a pull request. The following
https://github.com/mulesoft/citizen-platform-xapi-service/pull/278[pull request]
shows an example of that for Trello Connector.
+

.. Create a JSON file with the Connection Schema Metadata. Refer to the following
https://github.com/mulesoft/cfm/blob/master/docs/connection-ui-autogeneration/creating-connection-schema-metadata.md[link]
to learn how to create a Connection Schema Metadata file. The file name must be
based on the connection schema's GAV: `{groupId}-{artifactId}-{version}.json`.
.. Validate the Connection Schema Metadata with the xAPI by pushing a `test/`
branch with your metadata and hitting the endpoint. As a result, the
connectionSchemaModel property appears in the response with the
generated Connection Schema Model with its Metadata. The customizations are shown
in the metadata of the endpoint's response. Alternatively, validate it against
the CFM Connectivity Service.

+
`curl --location --request GET 'https://devx.composer.mulesoft.com/citizen-xapi/api/v1/organizations/ORG_ID/connection-schemas/connectors/CONNECTOR_NAME' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ANYPOINT_ACCESS_TOKEN'`
+

. Part 3: Validate the Auto Generated Connection UI

+
To validate that the Connection Creation UI is generated as expected, you must:
+

.. Open the Composer UI.
.. Create a new flow.
.. Select the connector which the Connection Schema was created for. Note that if
the connector does not have any triggers, it will not appear here and you will need
to search for the connector inside the flow.
.. Once, you have selected your connector, a loading spinner may appear and
when it goes away the form is generated.

+
If you added metadata and want to test it integrated with the UI, push a `test/`
or `integration/` branch with the added metadata and repeat the previous steps.
+


== Step 2.7: Onboard onto OCS (Optional)


Optionally onboard onto OCS using the following
https://github.com/mulesoft/ocs/blob/master/docs/common/onboarding-a-new-service-provider.md[steps].


[[onboardlower]]
== Step 2.8: Onboard Connector Onto Lower Environments

Use the following steps to onboard either a new connector or a new version of
an already onboarded connector.

=== Onboard a New Connector

. Create a customization model, for example, by using the
`./cli template trello` command. This creates a new file inside the
customization folder:

+
[source,yaml]
----
name: trello
displayName: Trello
description: MuleSoft Composer connector for Trello.
iconUrl: www.fakeurl.com/icon.jpg
artifactGav:  # TODO
  groupId: ???  # Usually 'com.mulesoft.connectors'
  artifactId: ???  # Probably either 'mule-trello-connector' or 'mule4-trello-connector'
  version: ???
configuration:  # TODO
  name: ???  # Usually 'config'

sources: []  # TODO
#  - name: ???
#    displayName: ???  # Optional
#    description: ???  # Optional
#    fields:  # Optional
#      - name: ???
#        displayName: ???  # Optional
#        description: ???  # Optional
#        visibility: SHOW
#        # ...
#    # ...

operations: []  # TODO
#  - name: ???
#    displayName: ???  # Optional
#    description: ???  # Optional
#    fields:  # Optional
#      - name: ???
#        displayName: ???  # Optional
#        description: ???  # Optional
#        visibility: SHOW
#        # ...
#    # ...
----
+

+
You can remove all of the `TODO` and placeholder `???`.
For now, fill in the `artifactGav` with the information of the specialist Connector that
corresponds to the Composer Connector. The following example is for Trello
Connector:
+

+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
artifactGav:
  groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
  artifactId: mule-trello-connector
  version: 1.2.0
# ...
----
+

. Optionally, download the extension model to use as a reference while completing
the rest of the customization model by using the `./cli extension trello` command.
This downloads the file into a JSON file.
. Fill in the rest of the customization model. Use the technical specification
and extension model to get the names of the operations and sources and their
respective fields.

+
[source,yaml]
----
name: trello
displayName: Trello
description: MuleSoft Composer connector for Trello.
iconUrl: www.fakeurl.com/icon.jpg
artifactGav:
  groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
  artifactId: mule-trello-connector
  version: 1.2.0
configuration:
  name: config

sources:
  - name: source1
    displayName: Source 1
    description: Source 1's description.
    fields:
      - name: field1
        displayName: Field 1
        description: Field 1's description.
        visibility: SHOW
        # ...
  # ...

operations:
  - name: operation1
    displayName: Operation 1
    description: Operation 1's description.
    fields:
      - name: field1
        displayName: Field 1
        description: Field 1's description.
        visibility: SHOW
        # ...
  # ...
----
+

. Run validations of the customization model while building it by using the
`./cli validate foo` command.
. Generate models using the cli tool by running `./cli connector trello` and then
`./cli transformation trello`. Alternatively, run `./cli both trello` to generate
both the conenctor and transformation.
. Patch the generated output.
.. Rename the version folder.
.. Add the *schedulingStrategy* transformation. For each source in the
`transformation_model.json`, add an entry on the transformations entry like this:
The following examples show the entry and the final transformation:
+
[source,json5]

{
  "type": "multipleTypedField",
  "name": "schedulingStrategy",
  "path": "General.schedulingStrategy",
  "dynamic": false,

  }
}

              "timeUnit": "SECONDS",
              "startDelay": 0
            },
            "CronScheduler": {
              "expression": "*****",
              "timeZone": "-3 GTM"
            }
          },
          "subtypes": {
            "FixedFrequencyScheduler": "org.mule.runtime.core.api.source.scheduler.FixedFrequencyScheduler",
            "CronScheduler": "org.mule.runtime.core.api.source.scheduler.CronScheduler"
          }
        }
        // ...
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
----
+

. Expose the new connector by adding the relevant entries to
https://github.com/mulesoft/citizen-platform-connectors-models-service/blob/master/citizen-platform-connectors-models-service/src/main/resources/application.yml[application.yaml]
under the path's `connectors.environments.<KDEV & KQA>.foo` and adding the
new version.

+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
connectors:
  environments:
    KDEV:
      # ...
      trello: 1.1.0
    KQA:
      # ...
      trello: 1.2.0
    # ...
# ...
----
+

. Add the connector to the unit tests, for which you should add similar entries
to https://github.com/mulesoft/citizen-platform-connectors-models-service/blob/master/citizen-platform-connectors-models-service/src/test/resources/connectors-configuration-test.yml[connectors-configuration-test.yml]:

+
[source,yaml]
----
KDEV:
  # ...
  trello: 1.1.0
KQA:
  # ...
  trello: 1.2.0
# ...
----
+

. Run `mvn clean test` to validate that the build passes.
. Create a pull request for your newly onboarded connector.
. Merge the pull request.


=== Onboard a New Version of an Already Onboarded Connector

The following steps apply only when:

* A schema already exists that is valid for a connector.
* A new version of the same connector has been released.
* The new version of the connector is compatible with the CFM schema. To check
schema compatibility:
  ** Verify that there are no changes in the `connectionProviders` part of the
  connector's extension model. Note that it is okay if other parts of the model
  have been modified.
  ** If there are changes in the `connectionProviders` part, verify that the
  connection provider with the same name as the schema's `labels.connectionProvider`
  has not been modified.
  ** If the matching connection provider has been modified, identify the
  differences and reach out the CFM team to further analyze the case.


If all of the above are true, you can proceed to onboard the new version using
the following steps:

. Open the schema.
. Under `assets`, add the GAV of the new connector version. For example, for
  the following schema:

+
[source,yaml]
----
  {
      "groupId": "com.mulesoft.schemas",
      "artifactId": "mule-trello-connector-platform-oauth",
      "version": "1.1",
      ...
      "assets": [
          {
          "groupId": "com.mulesoft.connectors",
          "assetId": "mule4-trello-connector",
          "version": "1.1.0"
          }
      ],
      ...
  }
----
+

. To onboard connector version `1.2.0`, the schema would look like this. Note that
some schema fields were omitted with `...` for brevity. Only the
assets section should be modified:

+
[source,yaml]
----
{
    "groupId": "com.mulesoft.schemas",
    "artifactId": "mule-trello-connector-platform-oauth",
    "version": "1.1",
    ...
    "assets": [
        {
        "groupId": "com.mulesoft.connectors",
        "assetId": "mule4-trello-connector",
        "version": "1.1.0"
        },
        {
        "groupId": "com.mulesoft.connectors",
        "assetId": "mule4-trello-connector",
        "version": "1.2.0"
        }
    ],
    ...
}
----
+

. Get your changes deployed.

* For lower environments (kdev, kqa): Check out branch `integration/main`, commit
your changes, and push. Your changes will be automatically deployed.
* For high environments (kstg, kprod, kprod-eu): Branch out from `master`, push
your changes, and create a pull request. You will need approval from the CFM team to merge.
After merging, merge `master` back into `integration/main` to prevent regressions
to older connector versions in lower environments.

== What's Next?

Now that you have fully designed and deployed your connector, you can iterate
over the design to add more features or fix bugs.
