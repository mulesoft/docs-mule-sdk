= Define a Value Provider
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

:page-aliases: value-resolver.adoc

Value providers give the possible values of the parameters of an operation.

Value providers also enable the connector to send a request to an endpoint and get the possible values from there, providing capabilities to extract the actual values from the server response.

== Definition
A Value Provider has two elements: a request and an item.

The `request` node is an <<../rest-sdk/data-expressions.adoc#HTTP Request, HTTP Request Data Expression>>. It is used to make a request to the server where the sample data must be obtained from.

The `items` node describes how the server response is manipulated to extract the parameter values. It consists of three expressions: `extraction`, `value` and `displayName`.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
| Expression | Required | Description
| extraction | Yes | Extracts an array of items from the server response. Each of these items is iterated to get its value and displayName.
| value | Yes | Gets the value for an item. This is the actual value the parameter will contain.
| displayName | No | Gets the display name for an item. The value is used as a display name if the expression is not provided.
|===

== Expression Context

Depending on the context, the expressions have access to the following variables.

payload:: The full response returned from the server.

attributes:: The response attributes returned from the server. These resemble the https://docs.mulesoft.com/http-connector/1.5/http-documentation#HttpResponseAttributes[HTTP Connector Response Attributes].

item:: When the response from the server is extracted and split, the item variable contains each of those split values.

The availability of these variables depending on the expressions is shown below:

[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|===
| |payload |attributes |item |parameters
|Item Display Name |Yes |Yes |Yes |-
|Item Value |Yes |Yes |Yes |-
|Item Extraction |Yes |Yes |- |-
|===


== Reusability

Similar to other resolvers, Value Providers can be declared locally (inline) or globally. When declared globally, they can be referenced multiple times from the different places they are used in.

=== Inline Declaration
Inline definitions can be useful for shorter Connector Descriptors that don't need reusability.
+
Inline definitions have access to the `queryParameter`, `uriParameter` and `header` variables, which are maps that contain the respective parameters declared in the operation.

==== Inline value provider example

[source, yaml]
----
endpoints:
  /message:
    operations:
      post:
        expects:
          queryParameter:
            channel:
              valueProvider:
                type: inline
                request:
                  path: /channels
                  method: get
                  binding:
                    queryParameter:
                      kind:
                        value: "#[queryParameter.kind]"
                items:
                  extraction:
                    expression: "#[payload.channels]"
                  value:
                    expression: "#[item.channelId]"
                  displayName:
                    expression: "#[item.channelName]"
----

This value provider sends a request to the `/channels` endpoint. It has access to the declared parameters of the operation. The HTTP Request uses the `queryParameter.kind` parameter that is declared in the API specification and binds its value to the `kind` query parameter that the server expects.


=== Global Declaration
Global definitions provide reuse capabilities. A globally declared Value Provider allows defining parameters to build a context of where it can be executed.

==== Global value provider example

[source, yaml]
----
valueProviders:
  channels:
    parameters:
      channelKind:
        type: string
    definition:
      request:
        path: /channels
        method: get
        binding:
          queryParameter:
            kind:
              value: "#[parameters.channelKind]"
      items:
        extraction:
          expression: "#[payload.channels]"
        value:
          expression: "#[item.channelId]"
        displayName:
          expression: "#[item.channelName]"

endpoints:
  /message:
    operations:
      post:
        expects:
          queryParameter:
            channel:
              valueProvider:
                type: reference
                id: channels
                arguments:
                  channelKind: queryParameter.kind
----

Since this value provider is declared globally, it doesn't have access to the operation parameters. Instead, it needs to declare a parameter that the referer operation will then pass an argument onto.
+
A `channelKind` parameter is declared in the `parameters` section of the global declaration. A value is assigned to it in the `arguments` section of the value provider reference. It is then used in the HTTP Request binding using the `parameters` variable. All of the declared parameters are present in that map.


== Example: Simple Value Provider

The following example shows the application of a Value Provider declaration and usage using the Slack API.

In this example, the `postMessage` method has a value provider implemented:
https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage

image::channel-parameter.png[]

This endpoint has a required `channel` parameter with possible values that can be obtained by making a request to another endpoint:
https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list

image:conversations-list-endpoint.png[]

A response from this endpoint looks like this:

[source,json5]
----
{
    "ok": true,
    "channels": [
        {
            "id": "C012AB3CD",
            "name": "general", [..]
        },
        {
            "id": "C061EG9T2",
            "name": "random", [..]
        },
        [..]
    ],
    "response_metadata": {
        "next_cursor": "dGVhbTpDMDYxRkE1UEI="
    }
}
----

With this, you can create a simple value provider that provides the possible values for the `channels` parameter.

[source,yaml]
----
valueProviders:
 channels:
   definition:
     request:
       path: /conversations.list
       method: get
     items:
       extraction:
         expression: “#[payload.channels]”
       displayName:
         expression: “#[item.name]”
       value:
         expression: “#[item.id]”
----

According to the example, the value provider must make a `GET` request to the `/conversations.list` endpoint using the path and method properties respectively.

The provider then extracts the array of values from the response with the `extraction` expression, and for each one of these items, `name` property is returned as *displayName*, and the `id` property is returned as *value*.

The user sees *displayName* in the dropdown for the possible channel values, and *value* is sent to the server.

You can then add this value provider to the `channels` parameter in the operation as shown:

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
 /chat.postMessage:
   operations:
     post:
       expects:
         queryParameter:
           channel:
             valueProvider:
               type: reference
               id: channels
----

== Example: Value Provider with Parameters

This example contains the previous parameter provider with more intelligence. This value provider uses the operation’s parameters to query for the appropriate type of channels.

[source,yaml]
----
valueProviders:
 channels:
   parameters:
      channelType:
        type: string
   definition:
     request:
         path: /conversations.list
         method: get
         binding:
           queryParameter:
             channelType:
               value:
                 expression: “#[if(parameters.channelType != null) parameters.channelType else ‘all’]”
   items:
      extraction:
         expression: “#[payload.channels]”
      displayName:
         expression: “#[item.name]”
      value:
         expression: “[item.id]”
----

This value provider resembles the previous one with the exception of the addition of the `binding` node. +

This example demonstrates forwarding parameters set in the operation of the value provider. These bound parameters can be used later to build the value provider request. +

In this example, the `channelType` query parameter is bound to the value provided in the operation `uriChannelType` URI parameter.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  /chat.postMessage/{uriChannelType}:
     operations:
       post:
         expects:
           queryParameter:
             channel:
               valueProvider:
                 type: reference
                 id: channels
                 arguments:
                    channelType:
                      value: uriParameter.uriChannelType
----

Setting the value provider to the operation is as simple as in the previous example, however in this case the bound parameters exist in the operation before generating the connector code.
