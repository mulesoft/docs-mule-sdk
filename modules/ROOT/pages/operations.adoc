Operations are one of the most important Mule concepts because they represent the actions your module can perform inside a flow. You use them to process incoming messages through business logic that is implemented in the module.

== Declaring Operations for a Config

Operations must be declared inside a separate class. See <<module-structure#, Structure>> to learn how to correctly organize your module's code.

TIP: A class is either a Config class or an Operations class. You cannot have both things mixed together in the same class.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Extension(name = "Foo")
@Operations(FooOperations.class)
public class FooModule {

    @Parameter
    private String fooModuleParameter;

    public String getFooModuleParameter() {
        return fooModuleParameter;
    }
}
----

All the public methods defined in `FooOperations` are going to be considered as our operations. If you want to have a public method inside your operation class but you don't want it to be consider as an operation, you
just need to annotate that method with `@Ignore`.

Like this:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class FooOperations {

    public String foo(@Config FooModule config) {
        return config.getFooModuleParameter();
    }

    private String thisIsNotAnOperation() {
        return "bar";
    }

    @Ignore
    public String thisIsNotAnOperationEither() {
        return "foobar";
    }
}
----

In the example above, the operation class is bound to the only config (which is the same as the extension class). This means that the operations defined in `FooOperations` are only available to be used with a certain type of configuration (`FooModule`, in this case).

TIP: Remember that you can use your extension as a config _if and only if_ it is the only configuration you have.

So, an operation named `foo` is defined. Because *it belongs to the configuration* `FooModule`, it can receive the configuration class as an argument annotated with the annotation `@Config`.

You cannot annotate the argument annotated as `@Config` with the annotations you use for any <<parameters#, Parameter>> because the config is not a parameter.

== Global Operations

Besides adding operations that are exclusive to a particular config, you can also add operations at extension level, that is, operations that are global to the module.

Operations at extension level cannot not have a config unless the extension class is the only config. This means that they are not bound to a config. To define operations at extension level, you need to annotate the extension class with your `@Operations` while having configurations defined, rather than using the extension class as your only config.

Take into account that this only makes sense if you have more than just one config. That's because if we only have the extension class (our only config),
then all the operations we define are bound to it.

The next example adds two configs and defines operations for each of them. Then it adds some operations that are global to the module.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Extension(name = "Foo")
@Operations(GlobalOperations.class)
@Configurations({FooConfig.class, BarConfig.class})
public class FooModule {
}
----

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class GlobalOperations {
    public String fooModuleOperation() {
        return "this operation is global to the module!";
    }
}
----

The example above defines a module with two configurations, `FooConfig` and `BarConfig`, and a set of operations defined in `GlobalOperations`.

Now, see the configs and their operations:

[[example_1]]
[source,java,linenums]
----
@Operations({FooConfigOperations.class})
public class FooConfig {

    @Parameter
    private String fooParameter;

    public String getFooParameter() {
        return fooParameter;
    }
}
----

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class FooConfigOperations {
    public String fooConfigOperation(@Config FooConfig config) {
        return "this operation receives the FooConfig which has a fooParameter with value: " + config.getFooParameter();
    }
}
----

The example above defines a new configuration named `FooConfig` with some exclusive operations defined in `FooConfigOperations`. Then it defines an operation named `fooConfigOperation`. Because it belongs to the configuration `FooConfig`, it can receive the configuration class as an argument annotated with the special annotation `@Config`.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Operations({BarConfigOperations.class})
public class BarConfig {

    @Parameter
    private String barParameter;

    public String getBarParameter() {
        return barParameter;
    }
}
----

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class BarConfigOperations {
    public String barConfigOperation(@Config BarConfig config){
        return "this operation receives the BarConfig which has a barParameter with value: " + config.getBarParameter();
    }
}
----

Defining an operation at the extension level (as with the `GlobalOperations` methods above) represents that the defined operations do not receive (and therefore do not need) any configuration to operate.

For more information about configurations, see <<configs#, Configs>>.

[[_using_connections]]
== Connected Operations

In addition to receiving a configuration as an argument, you can receive the connection as a _special_ argument. You do this by defining a <<connections#, Connection Provider>> for the configuration to which this operation belongs.

The next example adds a connection to a <<example_1, previous example>>.

Suppose that you define a `FooConnectionProvider` elsewhere that provides  connections of type `FooConnection`. (To learn how to define a Connection Provider, see <<connections#, Connection Provider>>.)

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Operations({FooConfigOperations.class})
@ConnectionProviders(FooConnectionProvider.class)
public class FooConfig {

    @Parameter
    private String fooParameter;

    public String getFooParameter() {
        return fooParameter;
    }
}
----

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class FooConfigOperations {
    public String fooConfigOperation(@Config FooConfig config){
        return "this operation receives the FooConfig!";
    }

    public String fooConnectedOperation(@Connection FooConnection connection){
        return "this operation receives FooConnection!";
    }

    public String fooConnectedOperation(@Config FooConfig config, @Connection FooConnection connection){
        return "this operation receives both config and connection!";
    }
}
----

Now, there are three different operations:

* One that receives the config `FooConfig`.
* One that receives the connection `FooConnection`.
* And one that receives the config `FooConfig` and gets a connection of type `FooConnection` provided by the `FooConnectionProvider` provider class.

== Operation Structure

An operation is defined from a Java method, which makes the mapping of the method's argument and the operation parameters straightforward. Following the same logic, the operation's output type is taken from the method's return type.

=== Output

The next sections explain how the output of an operation affects what happens in the flow when you invoke the operation.

==== Payload

The common behavior is to define an operation that returns any type that will be set in the operation output message's payload.

[source,java,linenums]
----

public String outputStringPayload(){
    return "this string is going directly into the payload!";
}
----

[TIP] If an operation specifies *only* a payload, then the message attributes will be set to `null`.

==== Void

A void operation is an operation that was created from a method that returns `void`. This operation does not modify the message received but does pass that message to the next component in the flow, for example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow>
    <set-payload value="Hello" />
    <foo:output-string-payload />
    <foo:void-operation />
    <foo:other-operation />
</flow>
----

Here, the message received in `void-operation` is the same as the one received in `other-operation`.

==== Result

If you want to output something more than a simple payload, such as information about the payload (attributes of the Mule message), you need to use a `Result` as the your method's return type. See <<result-object#, Result>> for more information.

=== Special Arguments

So, you can receive the a configuration and a connection in an operation. Are there other special arguments other than regular parameters? Yes.

Here are some special things you can receive as an argument in an operation,  and Mule will automatically inject the right value there for you:

* `AuthenticationHandler`: An argument of type `AuthenticationHandler` that allows you to configure the current context's authentication. This is used for encryption and inbound authentication.
* `StreamingHelper`: An argument of type `StreamingHelper` with utilities for working with streams. See <<streaming#, Streaming>> for more information.
* `DefaultEncoding`: An argument of type `String` annotated with `@DefaultEncoding` with information about the Runtime's default encoding.

[source,java,linenums]
----
public String foo(@DefaultEncoding String encoding) {
    return "Mule default encoding is " + encoding;
}
----

== Aliasing an Operation

You can change the name of an operation without having to change the name of the method by using `@Alias`. You can also alias the operation's parameters as explained in <<parameters#, Parameters>>.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Alias("fooOperation")
public void thisWillNotBeTheOperationName(@Alias("fooParameter") String aliasedParameter) {
}
----
