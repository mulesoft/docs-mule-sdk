The entry point for building a Mule module is the `@Extension` annotated class. This class is used to export all the module functionality and all the elements associated with it.

[WARNING]
This class *must* be a public, non-abstract class. The `@Extension` annotation cannot be used on interfaces, abstract classes, private/protected classes, or typed classes (with generics).

[source,java,linenums]

@Extension(name = "basic")
public class BasicModule {
}

When using the `@Extension` annotation, you need to provide a descriptive and concise name for your module. You should not use `extension`, `module`, or `connector` in the module name. If you do, the SDK will trim them. Optionally, you can specify the module `vendor` and the module `category` (See <<license#, Licensing>>).

Once you have created an empty module, you can start adding elements to it.

.Basic Module Structure
image::model.png[Module Basic Model Diagram]

At a high level, the elements are:

[[components]]
* <<Components>>
** <<operations#, Operations>>
** <<sources#, Sources>>
** <<functions#, Functions>>
** <<routers#, Routers>>
** <<scopes#, Scopes>>
* <<connections#, Connection Providers>>
* <<configs#, Configurations>>
* <<parameters#, Parameters>>

== Components

Components are the key to the functionality of a module. Given a set of parameters, they can be executed to produce or alter messages in a flow.

Sources and Operations are the most common components in a module:

* <<operations#, Operations>> are components that process an incoming message and generate a result.
* <<sources#, Sources>> are components that receive or generate new messages to be processed by the Mule Runtime.

== Configuration

Configurations are a set of configurable parameters that affect the behavior of the Module. <<sources#, Sources>> and <<operations#, Operations>> typically depend on a Configuration for parameters that determine their behavior. However, some can work on their own without a Configuration.

There is no requirement to declare a Configuration for a Module, but you can declare as many as you need. Different configurations might provide a different set of parameters and specify a set of <<operations#, Operations>> and <<sources#, Sources>> that are only available when using that configuration.

== Connection Providers

A <<connections#, Connection Provider>> is the Module element in charge of handling connections, which are created from a <<configs#, Configuration>>. They centralize the logic and parameterization
to provision and release connections of some specific type.

Like the <<configs#, Configurations>>, <<sources#, Sources>>, and <<operations#, Operations>>, Connection Providers typically depend on a connection in order to be executed. A connection is not required but is common. Connections used by <<operations#, Operations>> and <<sources#, Sources>> are provided by the <<connections#, Connection Provider>>.

<<connections#, Connection Providers>> are bound to <<configs#, Configurations>>. <<configs#, Configurations>> can have none, one,
or many <<connections#, Connection Providers>> that create different types of connections, for example, one `ConnectionProvider` for HTTPS and another for (non-secured) HTTP connections.

== Parameters

`Parameters` are the most granular elements on the module model, and they are used in all these elements: <<operations#, Operations>>, <<sources#, Sources>>, <<configs#, Configurations>>, and <<connections#, Connection Providers>>.

They represent configurable elements that accept the values for elements to execute, or they hold the configured values.

== Other Elements

A module can have other element types, for example, <<routers#, Routers>>, <<scopes#, Scopes>>, <<functions#, Functions>>, or <<errors#, Errors>>. The ones described here are the core elements that most modules are likely have.
